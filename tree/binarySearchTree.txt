Binary Search Trees
Binary Trees vs Binary Search Trees
Binary Search Trees (BST) are a variation of binary trees 
with the addition of a sorted property. The property is that 
every node in the left subtree is smaller than the root and 
every node in the right subtree is greater than the root.

This is a recursive property, meaning that it applies to
every node in the tree. This property is analogous to having a sorted array.


Motivation
With BSTs we can search for values in 

O(log n) time just like with a sorted array.

BSTs are often preferred over sorted arrays because they allow for insertion and deletion in 
O(log n) time. This is not possible with sorted arrays, which require 
O(n) time for these operations.
